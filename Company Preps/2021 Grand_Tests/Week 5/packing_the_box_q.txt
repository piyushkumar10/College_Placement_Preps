Krish has unpacked all his belongings and is now left with empty cardboard boxes. he has very minimal space in his apartment to store his boxes. Hence, he plans to put one inside the other in order to accommodate. However, one box can be fitted inside another only if the size of the bigger one is at least twice the size of the smaller one.

You are required to write a code by incorporating this scenario so that Krish gets to know the final number of boxes he has to accommodate.


For example, if the boxes are of sizes 2, 4 and 8, then Krish can pout the box 2 inside 4 and then 4 inside 8 thereby having only one box to optimize his space.
Input format
